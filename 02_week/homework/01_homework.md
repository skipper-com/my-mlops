## Q1. Downloading the data
We'll use the same NYC taxi dataset, but instead of "Green Taxi Trip Records", we'll use "Yellow Taxi Trip Records". Download the data for January and February 2022. Read the data for January. How many columns are there?
- 16
- 17
- 18
- 19
> Answer: 19


## Q2. Computing duration
Now let's compute the duration variable. It should contain the duration of a ride in minutes. What's the standard deviation of the trips duration in January?
- 41.45
- 46.45
- 51.45
- 56.45
> Answer: 46.45


## Q3. Dropping outliers
Next, we need to check the distribution of the duration variable. There are some outliers. Let's remove them and keep only the records where the duration was between 1 and 60 minutes (inclusive). What fraction of the records left after you dropped the outliers?
- 90%
- 92%
- 95%
- 98%
